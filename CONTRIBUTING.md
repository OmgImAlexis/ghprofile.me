**I don't want to read all of this, I just have a question!**
Please do not create an issue to ask a question, instead contact me in my [discord server](https://ghprofile.me/)

## Conventions and Styleguide

### Code
* use asynchronous functions instead of promises or callbacks
* respond in API endpoints with the following format - ``return res.status().json({}).end();`` and leave lines in json!

### Style
* use ``"`` instead of ``'``, everywhere possible!
* use semicolons everywhere except after closing ``}``s like in ``if`` statements
* use ``} else {`` don't move to the next line

Implement all style changes in your PR if a manager requests them.

### Thanks for contributing and happy coding! üéâ
